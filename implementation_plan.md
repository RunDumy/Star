# Implementation Plan

Successfully reviewed STAR platform deployment readiness and confirmed it's ready for local testing. The system has been optimized, environment variables configured, databases connected, and Docker orchestration prepared.

The platform includes a full-stack social network with cosmic/zodiac themes featuring astrology, tarot reading, 3D space visualization, live streaming, and real-time collaboration.

[Overview]
Execute local deployment testing of the STAR platform using Docker Compose to verify operational readiness before potential production deployment.

Multiple paragraphs outlining the scope, context, and high-level approach. The STAR platform provides a comprehensive cosmic social network with features including zodiac discovery rituals, tarot readings, 3D cosmic navigation, live streaming arenas, collaborative spaces, and astrological analysis. This implementation verifies the Docker-based deployment strategy ensuring both backend (Flask/Python) and frontend (Next.js/React) services start correctly, health endpoints respond, Azure Cosmos DB connections work, and all configured integrations (Agora RTC, JWT authentication, etc.) function properly.

[Types]
Data structure definitions for environment configuration and deployment parameters are already implemented.

Environment variables are properly typed with cryptographic secrets, connection strings, and service identifiers. Azure resource configurations use standard ARM templates and infrastructure as code patterns. API endpoints follow RESTful conventions with JSON responses.

[Files]
New files: None required - all necessary configuration files exist.

Existing files: docker-compose.yml already configured, .env file present with all required variables, Dockerfiles completed.

Configuration files: docker-compose.yml (handles service orchestration), .env (contains all environment variables), config/azure.yaml (Azure deployment configuration).

[Functions]
New functions: None - local testing doesn't add functionality.

Existing functions: Backend Flask application, health endpoint, API routes already implemented.

Frontend: Next.js build and dev server scripts already configured.

[Classes]
Classes are already implemented in the backend Flask application structure.

No new classes required for local deployment testing.

[Dependencies]
All Python dependencies installed (requirements.txt), Node.js packages configured (package.json), Azure SDKs and integrations ready.

Docker images: Backend uses python:3.14, frontend uses node:18.

External services: Azure Cosmos DB (configured), Agora RTC (ready), optional Spotify/Others (not required for core testing).

[Testing]
Health check testing: Backend /api/health endpoint, Frontend port 3000 reachability.

Core functionality testing: API connectivity, database operations, real-time features.

Integration testing: Frontend-backend communication, environment variable load.

Performance testing: Docker container startup times, health check responses.

[Implementation Order]
1. Verify Docker and docker-compose availability on system
2. Test backend container build and health check alone
3. Test frontend container build and accessibility
4. Run complete docker-compose orchestration
5. Verify inter-service communication (frontend connects to backend)
6. Test API endpoints and basic functionality
7. Validate Azure Cosmos DB connection and data operations
8. Test optional features (Agora streaming, real-time features) if enabled
9. Perform user journey testing (registration flow, cosmic features)
